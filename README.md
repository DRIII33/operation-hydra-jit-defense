# Operation Hydra: JIT Malware Defense & Revenue Protection

**Role:** Safe Revenue Workflow Manager, Google Trust & Safety (Compute)  

**Author:** Daniel Rodriguez III

**Context:** 2026 Agentic Threat Landscape  

## Project Mission
Standard antivirus and static signature detection are obsolete in 2026. **Operation Hydra** is a behavioral-first defense framework designed to identify the *intent* of an attacker rather than the *hash* of a file. By monitoring Shannon Entropy, CPU Burst Rates, and Egress Tunneling, we protect Google Cloud's compute integrity and safe revenue.

## The Stack
- **Data Engineering:** Google BigQuery (SQL) for log aggregation and tiered ROI logic.
- **AI/Agentic Reasoning:** Gemini 3 Pro (Google AI Studio) for intent classification.
- **Logic Engine:** Python (Weighted Scoring Model) with Synergy Bonus detection.
- **Impact Visualization:** Looker Studio (Executive Impact Dashboard).

## Executive Impact (Q1 2026)
- **Total Revenue Protected:** $12.70K (Focus on Enterprise IP Integrity).
- **Enforcement Precision:** 95.45% (Peak precision for Hard-Block automated workflows).
- **Incident Velocity:** Real-time identification of JIT "Burst" signatures (0-15 transaction scale).
- **Containment:** 340 High-Risk threats successfully mitigated out of 402 detections (84.5% automated containment rate).

## Key Innovation: The Synergy Bonus
Our engine applies a `SYNERGY_BONUS` when high Entropy and JIT-regeneration occur simultaneously. This allows us to trigger **Hard-Blocks** at 95%+ confidence for Model Extraction attempts while using **Adaptive Throttling** for lower-confidence Lateral Propagation.
